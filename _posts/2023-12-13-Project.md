## About the project

This Kaggle project is about to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equiment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuaration.  The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.

The fictional enterprise name is ´Fast Iron´ and the data provided has been normalized and the goal of the enterprise is to create a "blue book for bull dozers," for customers to value what their heavy equipment fleet is worth at auction.

Something that is mentioned in the competition is to evaluate the RMSLE((root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.
